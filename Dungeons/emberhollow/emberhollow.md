# Emberhollow
- Frozen Mining town on the coast

- produce lots of weapons and armor, along with lots of stone that is used for construction.
- local wizard will occasionally buy a collection of weapons/armor, enchant them, and re-sell them for more
- over seas trade with other places
- export weapons, armor, stone, copper, iron, steel, gold, some magic items
- import lumber, fabrics, some food stuff
- heavy fortifications facing inland - the city is sufficiently equipped to fend off a dragon
- the island was a home for dragons ages ago. most have died off, their time on the island left it full of riches (hence the mining) (there's also a lot of dwarves)
- some dragons remain, ancient and powerful.

# Kiera's storyline idea(s)

## 1. Corrupt government

- the corrupt people in the government do a really good job making it look like the corruption
    comes from 1 person (an advisor)
- there should be a decent amount of exploring that leads you to think the advisor is corrupt.
- VERY subtle details hint that the advisor is innocent
- incredibly small detail that will lead to you finding out who the actualy corruption is,
    but it should feel like you've explored the city 3 times over before you find this
- you have very little influence on any government stuff
- You need to be extremely careful, as the corrupt government has a lot of influence, and may get you killed.
- if you do get killed by the government, they have to cover it up, if you come back as a new player, finding
    evidence of your previous death(s) can greatly help in bringing the government down (there will also be evidence of
    deaths besides yours, but *your* death should be what lets you as a player know that you can find evidence of deaths)

accused advisor:
│ - you have to put effort into spreading awareness that the advisor is corrupt
│ - if you let one of the actually corrupt people know that the advisor is corrupt, that gives them time to plot against you,
│     and/or create a new cover
│ - after revealing to the corrupt gov, depending on how long it takes you to inform enough of the population, the obviousness
│     of who's actually corrupt will change. (if you inform people quickly, the gov will be a bit more obviously corrupt, and
│     if you take a long time to inform people, the gov has more time to prepare, and will be less obvious)

skipped accusation of advisor, thinking there's more to the story:
│ - you will have to put a lot more time and effort into uncovering clues against the actually corrupt people

accusing the advisor AND other parts of the government:
│ - more evidence will show up that will try to convince you that only the advisor is corrupt
│ - the longer you take to make a decision, the more desperate the gov will be, making them more obvious.

the slow-burn plot twist:
│ - the advisor is actually corrupt, but he's part of a very evil group that wants to conquer everything, if word gets out
│     that the city thinks the advisor is corrupt, the evil group will hear, and after a while:
│ If the advisor is still in the government:
│ │ - A very powerful attack will be launched from within the city, and might not end well.
│ If you got the advisor imprisoned:
│ │ - A small but powerful team will be sent to break him out and take him back to the evil base. (this advisor is a very
│ │     valuable asset to this group)
│ If the advisor was banished:
│ │ - He will have a grudge against you, and in the future, may make life incredibly difficult.



# City creation notes

1. What Essential services and NPC's are needed?

2. What features build on the story and lore for your world?

3. How do we make this feel like a vibrant and believable place?

where's the inn?
where to buy equipment?
- blacksmiths may only make nails, tools, etc, not high-end weapons
- use population to determine max costs for stuff

place to sell loot?

who's in charge?

where to gather information?
- inn, markets, etc...

who has magical powers?
where to get healing?
towns will not have very strong spell casters. (<= 3rd level dnd)

- can't have too many adventurous people (recruitment issues)

- problems in town? (see [above](#kieras-storyline-ideas))
- mini sub adventures

other questions for myself:
name of the town? Emberhollow
what is the population? ~100-200 (with NPC's for almost all of them...)
where do people live? (~5 people per house)
where do food and water come from? The ocean
what kind of foods and drinks are sold? Fish, bread
defences? castle wall
culture & religion?
major resource? mining and fishing
landmarks and special locations? The Keslite Forge, The Dragon keep, experimental telecomms base, secondary space control base

scale to city size:

multiple places to get the same things (based on preferences)

Where do you go to eat here?  vs  What's a good place to eat nearby?

City is like multiple towns/districts with more specifics

think about specialized districts
what districts are there?
what do they have in them?

types of districts:
- market district
- old town district - where the city started
- military/castle district
- docks/ocean district
- industrial district
- the sewers
- temple district
- nobles district - avoid the docks and industrial districts
- entertainment district
- the slums
- residential districts
- etc...
