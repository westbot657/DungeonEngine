## The Ethereal plane
a realm outside of reality, in sleep, one can vaguely see whispers of this place
but with strong enough magic, one may find their way through the fog between realities, and enter the ethereal plane.
however, if the magic fails or is not strong enough, and your dream wlaking is disturbed, on may become lost, unable to be woken, they must be found by entering the fog.
A strong psychic link between 2 people, one in reality, one in the ethereal plane, can hold a physical portal open for a time. This is the only way to physically transport yourself between realities.
It is dangerous for your mind to travel through this portal, while it does work, you are locked into the reality, and the only way to awaken, is to find your physical form. (you're in reality, dreamwalk to the etheral plane, go through portal back to reality)


# Lore stuff
.
. A powerful man from the ethereal plane dreamwalks to reality (this is a common thing to do)
. he then tries to create a psychic link to himself (this has never been done before, nor will be done again)
: a portal opens between the ethereal plane and reality.
| creating a psychic link with yourself through realities shatters the empty void of reality.
: The memories of this man are manifested into reality, creating the universe
| the portal that was opened pulls a large amount of life from the ethereal plane into reality.
: the sudden eruption of life and time and space in reality makes dreamwalking near impossible for a very long time.
| most of these creatures immediately die in the void of space, but some end up on planets, and start a new life, and the ethereal plane is mostly forgotten.
: The dragons are the only to remember the ethereal plane, and they pass this knowledge down through the generations.
┼ Here marks the beginning of time, and the start of the draconic era.
