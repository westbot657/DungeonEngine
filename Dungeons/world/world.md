# Lore stuff

Ethereal elements:
- Astreatium - Radiates Ethereal energy. It is a left-over fragment of the portal at the beginning of time (see [timeline](#timeline)), so it's a very rare metal
- Escian - Radiates life
- Sapryx - Radiates death
- Fostrite - Radiates extreme cold. In very low quantities (< 1 gram), it can be handled carefully, and will freeze anything it touches
- Droitium - Radiates extreme heat. In very low quantities, will ignite flamable materials, and start to melt some stones and metals

- Keslite - Absorbs most forms of energy. Can only be forged using the heat of lots of Droitium, which also makes the forging difficult to do.
            extremely good material for armor, very bad material for weapons. but also the only way to safely handle Fostrite and Droitium for long periods of time 
            (besides dragons being able to hold these metals)

- Vetrum - An extremely conductive material, and extremely toxic to touch bare-handed
- Keflian - Strangely magnetic. doesn't attract normal magnets or metals, but magnetizes to Fostrite, Droitium, and Escian. Used in compasses on Erus.
            Explodes on contact with Sapryx. when combined with Vetrum, creates Krianor

- Krianor - The compound of Vetrum and Keflian. When this compound is in contact with Astreatium, it acts as a battery with Astreatium being ground,
            and Krianor being positive.

- Shadestone - stone that emmits darkness. makes nearby light sources look dim.


Dragons don't *need* to breath, meaning they can travel through space, but their breath weapon relies on an atmosphere
each element affects the dragon's breath weapon,
so after a long enough exposure to an element, a dragon's breath weapon will change:
- Astreatium - puts victims in a heavy sleep
- Escian - heals (for friendly dragons I guess)
- Sapryx - kills victims, and then raises them from the dead.
- Fostrite - Ice breath
- Droitium - Fire breath
- Vetrum - Lightning breath
- Keflian - not really a breath weapon, but the dragon can attract or repulse metals at will within a specific range
- Shadestone - Breath a heavy, dark smoke.

breaths can also mix if a dragon is irradiated by multiple elements simultaneously.
special mixes:
- Escian & Sapryx - based on the dragons mood, can bring someone to near-death or increase their strength
- Fostrite & Droitium - Breath spews lava
- Escian & Droitium - Creates an exceptionally bright flame that spreads with little effort
- Sapryx & Droitium - Fire withers rather than burns
- Escian & Fostrite - Water breath
- Sapryx & Fostrite - Acid breath

## The Ethereal plane
a realm outside of reality, in sleep, one can vaguely see whispers of this place
but with strong enough magic, one may find their way through the fog between realities, and enter the ethereal plane.
however, if the magic fails or is not strong enough, and your dream wlaking is disturbed, on may become lost, unable to be woken, they must be found by entering the fog.
A strong psychic link between 2 people, one in reality, one in the ethereal plane, can hold a physical portal open for a time. This is the only way to physically transport yourself between realities.
It is dangerous for your mind to travel through this portal, while it does work, you are locked into the reality, and the only way to awaken, is to find your physical form. (you're in reality, dreamwalk to the etheral plane, go through portal back to reality)


# Timeline

(if this looks like a jumbled mess, zoom out or make the window wider)

.
. A powerful man from the ethereal plane dreamwalks to reality (this is a common thing to do)
. he then tries to create a psychic link to himself (this has never been done before, nor will be done again)
: a portal opens between the ethereal plane and reality.
| creating a psychic link with yourself through realities shatters the empty void of reality.
: The memories of this man are manifested into reality, creating the universe
| the portal that was opened pulls a large amount of life from the ethereal plane into reality.
: the sudden eruption of life and time and space in reality makes dreamwalking near impossible for a very long time.
| most of these creatures immediately die in the void of space, but some end up on planets, and start a new life, and the ethereal plane is mostly forgotten.
: The dragons are the only to remember the ethereal plane, and they pass this knowledge down through the generations.
┼ Here marks the beginning of time, and the start of the draconic era.
